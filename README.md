## What is Sage?

Sage is a programming language that tries to be maximally portable, expressive, and intuitive. It borrows some aspects of Rust, C, and Python. It currently has an x86 compiler backend, a C source backend, and a VM interpreter backend [which can run on the web](https://adam-mcdaniel.net/sage).

Sage is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), and has been under development since April 2022.

## Why Sage?

Sage is very portable -- run it on your thermostat! Here's the complete list of core virtual machine instructions and their C equivalents:

| Instruction | C Equivalent    |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| `while`     | `while (reg) {` |
| `if`        | `if (reg) {`    |
| `else`      | `} else {`      |
| `end`       | `}`             |
| `set N`     | `reg = N;`      |
| `call`      | `funs[reg]();`  |
| `ret`       | `return;`       |
| `save`      | `*tape_ptr = reg;` |
| `res`       | `reg = *tape_ptr;` |
| `move N`    | `tape_ptr += N;`   |
| `where`     | `reg = tape_ptr;`   |
| `deref`     | `push(tape_ptr); tape_ptr = *tape_ptr;` |
| `refer`     | `tape_ptr = pop();` |
| `index`     | `reg = (cell*)(reg) + *tape_ptr;`    |
| `add`       | `reg += *tape_ptr;` |
| `sub`       | `reg -= *tape_ptr;` |
| `mul`       | `reg *= *tape_ptr;` |
| `div`       | `reg /= *tape_ptr;` |
| `rem`       | `reg %= *tape_ptr;` |
| `nand`      | `reg = ~(reg & *tape_ptr);` |
| `gez`       | `reg = reg >= 0;`  |

You could fit this instruction set on a T-shirt!

The compiler can target this limited "core" instruction set, with an expanded "standard" instruction set for floating point operations and foreign functions. The core instruction set is designed to be as simple as possible for anyone to implement their own backend. [Try to see if you can implement it yourself for your backend of choice!](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage/blob/main/src/targets/c.rs)

The virtual machine has some important optimization properties: Although Sage's VM is a *very simple* zero-address-code representation, it preserves all the information to *reconstruct* an LLVM-like three-address-code representation of the original higher level IR. This makes the instruction set capable of applying LLVM's optimizations while being *much easier* to implement. **Sage's innovation is in the backend, not the frontend.**

This combination of simplicity and capacity for optimization was my motivation for creating Sage. I wanted to create a virtual machine with the largest **speed + expression + portability** to **implementation difficulty** ratio, and a high level language that could compile to it. I think Sage is a good solution to this problem.

This project is based on some ideas I had while working on [Harbor](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/harbor) for a hackathon.

## How useful is Sage?

Sage is a very young project, and is not ready for production. It's still possible to write very useful programs in it, though.

[SageOS is an operating system with a userspace written in Sage.](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage-os) Its graphical shell and presentation app (both written in Sage) use the FFI to draw to the screen, receive input from the mouse and keyboard, interact with the filesystem, and schedule new processes. [You can look at the shell code here.](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage/tree/main/examples/sage-os/shell.sg)

[![Shell1](assets/shell1.png)](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage-os)
[![Shell2](assets/shell2.png)](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage-os)

The presentation app parses PPM image files from the filesystem and renders them to the screen. [You can look at the presentation code here.](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage/tree/main/examples/sage-os/presentation.sg)

[![Presentation](assets/presentation.png)](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage-os)

Sage's foreign function interface is simple and can directly call C functions or backend-specific builtins. Check out the [web-demo](https://adam-mcdaniel.net/sage)'s foreign function interface example that calls some JavaScript code to draw graphics or alert the user!

## How do I use Sage?

To start using sage, install it with cargo:

```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage
```

Then, you can run a sage file with the `sage` command:

```bash
$ sage examples/frontend/interactive-calculator.sg
```

You can also compile a sage file to C with the `--target` flag:

```bash
$ sage examples/frontend/interactive-calculator.sg --target c
$ # Or `-t c` for short
$ sage examples/frontend/interactive-calculator.sg -tc
$ gcc out.c -o out
$ ./out
```

Check out the [code for the web-demo](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage/tree/main/examples/web) to see how to use Sage in a web page.

## What does Sage look like?

Here's an example of a polymorphic linked list in Sage using Rust-like `enum`s! It's straightforward to implement operations like `map` with just a few lines.

Here's an example of Sage's structural typing: a `Rectangle` can be created by concatenating the fields of a `Position` and a `Size`!


<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/code2.png" width="66%"/>
</div>


Here's an example of Sage's pattern matching: it's easy to deconstruct a value using `match`, `if let`, or a simple `let` binding. Sage's `match` expressions are very powerful!

## How do I contribute?

If you want to contribute, you can open an issue or a pull request. [Adding backends for other architectures is a great way to contribute!](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage/blob/main/src/targets/c.rs) We also need a VSCode syntax highlighting extension!
